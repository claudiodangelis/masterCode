Smart Clock
===========

This code will display time, weather and news feed. 

Runs as a php script on a web server with basically no external dependencies. Can use socket.io for XBEE integration, but isn't required for basic functionality.

Modify js/config.js to change some general variables (language, wather location, compliments, news feed RSS) and calendar.php to add your own ICS calendar
